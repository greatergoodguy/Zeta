- Glide needs to ease in, Glide instantly changes gravity
- Have Ninja oriented perpendicular to the ground, only when running
- Wall Jump Controls need to be polished, hard to hit space and left/right control at the same time, Add 0.5 second threshold
- Normal Jumping needs higher terminal velocity
- Should not slide when on sloped ground
- Colliders not aligned when looking left, due to image not being centered
